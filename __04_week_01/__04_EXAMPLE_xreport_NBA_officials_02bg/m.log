I couldn't find an `=' or `:=' after the

so I guess I'll just ignore it and carry on.

I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

                   ;
l.67 beginchar("m",dims);
                         
That macro has more parameters than you thought.
I'll continue by pretending that each missing argument
is either zero or null.

I can't set an internal quantity to anything but a known
numeric value, so I'll have to ignore this assignment.

expression that is shown above this error message,
so I guess I'll just ignore it and carry on.

so I had better not try to end anything.
